I am creating a portal for them to participate in clinical studies.
The portal is written in Next.js setup with the app router method. I have defined headers, footers and a navbar (already included in the layout). The following components are also already present

accordion.tsx
alert-dialog.tsx
alert.tsx
aspect-ratio.tsx
avatar.tsx
badge.tsx
breadcrumb.tsx
button.tsx
card.tsx
carousel.tsx
chart.tsx
checkbox.tsx
collapsible.tsx
command.tsx
context-menu.tsx
date-picker.tsx
dialog.tsx
drawer.tsx
dropdown-menu.tsx
form.tsx
hover-card.tsx
input-otp.tsx
input.tsx
label.tsx
menubar.tsx
navigation-menu.tsx
pagination.tsx
popover.tsx
progress.tsx
radio-group.tsx
resizable.tsx
scroll-area.tsx
select.tsx
separator.tsx
sheet.tsx
sidebar.tsx
skeleton.tsx
slider.tsx
sonner.tsx
switch.tsx
table.tsx
tabs.tsx
textarea.tsx
toast.tsx
toaster.tsx
toggle-group.tsx
toggle.tsx
tooltip.tsx
use-mobile.tsx
use-toast.ts
If you need any more details on any component, ask for it. But otherwise, use that component in coding any pages I request.

Also, following are the current dependencies.
Rewrite any UI pages if they use other alternatives with these (encouraging as much code reuse as possible)

  Create a new page for adding a clinical trial by the clinic user. This is the schema for the trial. Encode in a TypeScript object that can be uploaded to the firestore collection "trials".
  Add a fill with dummy details button and add appropriate values in the dummy data. Below is the schema for a trial.
  ```

  phase: string, // clinical trial phase (e.g., "Phase I", "Phase II", "Phase III", "Phase IV")
  title: string, // title of the clinical trial
  brief_summary: string, // a brief summary of the trial
  drug: string, // specific drug administered (or any detail related to it)

    },
  ],
  exclusion_criteria: [ // criteria that disqualify patient enrollment
    {
      criterion: string, // description of an exclusion criterion
    },
  ],
  enrollment_capacity: number, // maximum number of participants allowed in the trial
  sponsor: string, // name of the organization sponsoring the trial
  locations: [ // study site details
    {
      location_id: string, // unique identifier for the study site
      address: string, // street address of the study site
      city: string,
      state: string,

    },
  ],
  start_date: datetime, // trial start date (ISO 8601 format recommended)
  end_date: datetime, // trial end date or projected completion date
  status: string, // current status (e.g., "recruiting", "active", "completed", "terminated")
  contact_info: { // details for trial inquiries (ensuring secure handling per HIPAA)
    phone: string,
    email: string,
    website: string,
  },
  data_security_details: string, // summary of security measures (e.g., encryption, access controls) per HIPAA guidelines
  study_results: [ // records of trial outcomes and interim analyses

      outcome: string, // description of the outcome (e.g., "positive", "negative", "inconclusive")
    },
  ],
  adverse_events: [ // logged adverse events during the trial
    {

  updated_at: datetime, // timestamp when the trial record was last updated
  additional_comments: string[], // list of additional remarks or notes regarding the trial
  matching_criteria: string[], // list of specific criteria used to match participants (e.g., genetic markers, symptom profiles)
}
  ```
