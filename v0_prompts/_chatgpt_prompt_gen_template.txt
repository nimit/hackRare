I am creating a portal for a platform that helps individuals afflicted with rare diseases to participate in specialized clinical trials with the utmost focus on security, privacy and automatically matching individuals with clinical studies based on their data.
The application is named CURE NET (Clinical Unified Research Network).
Your task is to understand and expand the list of tasks into detailed instructions.
Write a detailed prompt that explains how to create the website pages as per my instructions.
Also include any logic/navigation that should be added.
We are using firebase auth and firestore for backend connection and react for the frontend (using next.js). All the api calls and interaction should be directly from react.js because the end goal is to export as a static website (only HTML/CSS/JS) website.

The tasks are:
- Remove "Google sign-in"
- Add a light/dark mode toggle button
- Create an beautiful, attention grabbing landing page with a big hero section and use the '/' route to redirect to it. The landing page can redirect to the login/signup page at path '/login' if the user is not logged in.
If the user is signed in, only have a single button that will lead the user to the dashboard.
As the user is logged in, store that users document from firestore on path: "patient_users/uid" where uid is the uid from firebase auth userCredential.
- Design a dashboard that retrieves trial data from the "trials" collection on firestore. It will retrieve documents from path "trials/trial_id" where trial_id is the from the list of ids where the user can participate from the "approved_trials" field. Limit to 5 trials and display them in a card format. When the user clicks on the card, redirect to page 'trial/trial_id' that shows detail of the trial.

The patient model is:
```
{
    user_id: string, // value of firebase auth token
    name: string,
    age: string,
    gender: string,
    height: [

        state: string,
        country: string,
      },
    ],
